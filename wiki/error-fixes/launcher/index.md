> [!WARNING] MESSAGE FROM LAUNCHER DEVELOPER
> Launcher at the moment has no support from me if you want to continue to support the launcher you can write me in Discord: `awalki_`.
Launcher is written in Tauri + Next.js if you are familiar with these technologies, you can try to become a developer on MRON. From me you will get the role of Coder



## Launcher isn't starting
- Download WebView 2 (if not installed, in some windows builds it cutted)
- Update to Windows 10/11 (if you have older than win 10)

## MRON Mod download failed with error
- Server isn't work at the moment.
- Maybe you should try to use vpn.

## Game isn't launching
